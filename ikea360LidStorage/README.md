# IKEA 360 Lid Storage
Organizer to store the plastic lids for the IKEA 360 food storage containers vertically so they are both easy to access and stop sticking together as they do when stacked.

The way I designed it you can regenerate the openSCAD files, and then render that and export to stl for a variety of other organizational tasks if desired.

## Printing
I printed the listed STL file using 5% infill in PLA, with 0.2mm layer height on a Prusa mks3+. I would not go for lower infill than the 5% I used and I would go higher if being repurposed for anything bigger or heavier than plastic lids

## Resizing
